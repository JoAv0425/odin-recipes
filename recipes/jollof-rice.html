    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Jollof rice</strong> is a popular West African dish known for its
         rich tomato base, vibrant red color, and bold, smoky flavor. 
         It is typically made by cooking rice in a well-seasoned blend of 
         tomatoes, peppers, onions, and spices, allowing the grains to 
         absorb the sauce and develop a deep, savory taste. Often prepared 
         for celebrations and family gatherings, Jollof rice is valued for 
         its simplicity, versatility, and ability to pair well with proteins 
         like chicken, beef, or fish.</p>
